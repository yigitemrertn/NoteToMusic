# NoteToMusic

## Description
This application probably wont work when you download it beacuse i couldnt upload some files;
remote: warning: File NoteToMusic/bin/Debug/dll/x64/OpenCvSharpExtern.dll is 58.89 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
remote: warning: File packages/OpenCvSharp4.runtime.win.4.10.0.20241108/OpenCvSharp4.runtime.win.4.10.0.20241108.nupkg is 59.88 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB

So you have to download this package manually

## Usage
Just press the "Please select a file" button and select your note schema then wait for a message box (message box gonna say "Hata:" but dont worry it still works perfect) then click the Play button and there you go
